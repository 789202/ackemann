# Bucholz seunence attempt (up to BHO)
Bucholz sequnence is a simple sequence system(not really) but it reaches ψ(Ω_ω) using Bucholz OCF.They have some very similar FS(Fundamental sequence).So here is how i understand it.
# My (probably ill-defined) definition.
Before 0,1,3 it is just the same as f_e0(7)in487bytes.py
After that 0,1,3 has this sequence 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7...
To find 0,1,3,1 we search for the BAD PART 1<3 next(bp=3) 1=1 next(bp=3,1) 1>0 diff 1 complete reached the end bp=3,1,0.Reversed 0,1,3 got it?
To find 0,1,3,1,3 we again search. 3>1 diff=2 no more diff search.So diff=2 no more diff=2 large complete.Result 0,1,3,1,2,3,4...
Then 0,1,3,2 search i will skip it to get bp=3,1 reverse 1,3 which is larger than 0,1,3.1,3>0,1,3.And the sequence is 0,1,3,1,3,1,3...
0,1,3,2,4 diff=2 search stop no more diff=2 so 0,1,3,2,3,4...
0,1,3,3 3=3 bp=3 diff=2.Woah this is interesting but now we use 1,3 difference of 2 and copy starting with n like 0,1,3,2,4,3,5,4,6...
Then something similar like
0,1,3,4=0,1,3,3,3... cuz badpart
0,1,3,4,6=0,1,3,4,5,6... cuz diff 2
0,1,3,5=0,1,3,4,6,7,9... cuz 2 diff 2
and so on...
